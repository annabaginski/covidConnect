# CovidConnect

CovidConnect is a dashboard for patients and healthcare workers to stay connected and updated in an efficient manner. 
As someone who worked as a Public Health Nurse during the Covid-19 Pandemic lockdowns,
one of the biggest issues we faced on the Covid-19 team was being able to remain
in contact with currently monitored Covid-positive patients while case surges
continued to add an incredible amount of new Covid-positive patients that also
required timely follow-up for assessment, education, etc. 

This application allows patients to log in and complete an initial intake (complete
with personal information, symptom assessents, contact-tracing, etc.), daily
assessments, access resources applicable to their location, and request follow-up
from nurses if necessary.

## Optimizations

**Stretch Goals (currently and continuously working on):**

- Dynamically adjusting countdown timer to pull from initial intake form upon completion
- Tracking and graph visualization of progression of symptoms accessible by patient and nurse
- Security to allow for safe upload of PHI (lab results); upload allowed only by healthcare worker account

**Super Stretch Goals:**

- Allowing healthcare worker accounts to pull and link together reported acquisitions and contacts from contact-tracing informationsubmitted by patients; addition of map to visualize spread and coverage
